The Eastside PyLadies are Creating a game that will eventually become an Alexa App.

The game will randomly generate a unique 3 digit number sequence, with no repeating numbers.

Users will submit "guesses", and the code will return 1 of the following messages:

"P" - one of the digits is correct, but in the incorrect place in the number sequence
"B" - none of the digits are correct
"F" - one of the digits are correct and is in the correct place in the number sequence
"FF" - 2 of the digits are correct and in the correct place in the number sequence
"FFF" - Congrats!!! You have won the game and correctly guessed the correct 3 digit number sequence!
